# imperative - purely procedural block
# series of proceureds fine grnained control think C (granularirty) abstraction slightly above ASM
# we know precisely what will happen with our side effects 
# referential transparency x :: x -> x
# fn close
# this can now be passed around as fn

# array data processing block
# series of array expressions think APL multidiemensioanl data processing (spatial)
